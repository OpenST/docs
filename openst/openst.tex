\section{Openly Scaling Blockchains}

\subsection{OpenST Gateway}

Assumption that state root is known to the respective other chain.

\subsection{OpenST Mosaic}

Mosaic transfers blockchain state roots from a source to a target.

%Consider an origin blockchain $O$ which is assumed to have liveliness and BFT security properties.  The origin blockchain produces blocks $e_i$ at height $i$.
