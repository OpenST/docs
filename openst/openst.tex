\subsection{OpenST Gateway}
\label{subsec:gateway}

OpenST Gateway enables chain-to-chain transfer of state objects.

% TODO mention that mosaic nodes are running and observing
% TODO do we need to play casper about origin? we trail behind a 2/3 vote could be sufficient
% TODO are OSTblocks "checkpoints" on auxiliary?
\subsection{OpenST Mosaic}
\label{subsec:mosaic}
% TODO which properties of the origin chain should we assume? Is it ethereum? PoW? BFT lively?
OpenST Mosaic enables chain-to-chain state transfer.
That allows us to secure an insecure chain's state on a secure chain.
We call the secure chain \emph{origin} $\OC$ and the insecure one \emph{auxiliary} $\A$.
% TODO is it really required to do casper about origin? we will trail behind head and a simple 2/3 majority should be sufficient. What about other block proposal mechanisms on origin?
In order to be blockchain proposal mechanism agnostic, we layer Casper~\cite{casperffg} on top of both chains.

% TODO the following paragraph is misplaced, not all concepts are known
% TODO What does "verify" state mean?
In order to transfer and verify state, it is required to transfer state bi-directionally between auxiliary and origin.
% TODO what does finalise on origin mean
% TODO what does it give to finalise on origin?
That way, auxiliary can verify that its state has been finalised on origin and
the set of validators, that is tracked on origin, is also known to auxiliary.

% TODO *mosaic* validators?
% TODO what is state
\emph{Validators} are actors that vote on state.
% TODO what do we mean by similar
% TODO introduce slashing here?
They are similar to validators in Casper~\cite{casperffg}.
Their deposit is stored on origin.
Similarly to Casper, their deposit rises and falls with rewards and penalties, respectively.
When we say "$\frac{2}{3}$ of validators", we equally refer to the deposit-weighted fraction.
However, there are different kinds of voting message types, as described below.

% TODO describe that OSTblock headers announce the set of validators for the following OSTblock
The set of validators needs to be able to change.
The logic is similar to that of Casper with the notable difference that, instead of dynasties, we use OSTblocks (described below).
When a potential validator sends a \emph{deposit message} on origin at OSTblock height $\alpha$,
then the validator $\upnu$ will join the validator set at OSTblock height $\alpha+2$.
% TODO a lot copied from Casper. OK? Required?
Analogous to Casper, we call $\alpha+2$ the validator's \emph{start OSTblock}, $\BS(\upnu)$.
If a validator $\upnu$'s withdraw message is included on origin's blockchain during an open OSTblock $\B_\alpha$,
it similarly leaves the set of validators at OSTblock height $\alpha+2$.
We call $\alpha+2$ the validator $\upnu$'s \emph{end OSTblock} $\BE(\upnu)$.

% TODO *mosaic* validators?
% TODO should we have different names for mosaic validators and "casper on origin" validators?
% TODO inparaenum not clear enough; maybe split it into paragraphs
Validators can vote on a number of events:
% TODO are these different kinds of validators?
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
	\item origin state transfers to auxiliary,
	\item checkpoint justifications on auxiliary, and
 	\item auxiliary state transfers to origin.
\end{inparaenum}
When state is transferred from origin to auxiliary,
% TODO language; unclear; add explanation; do we need it?
the validators vote according to the Casper rules like the state transfer represents a checkpoint.
On auxiliary, checkpoints are justified by supermajority links as described in Casper.
Casper applied to auxiliary the same way its application to Ethereum is described in the Casper paper.
% TODO what is a commit?
When auxiliary's state is transferred to origin, a simple $\frac{2}{3}$ majority vote on that state commits it to origin.

\emph{OSTblocks} are a compressed representation of auxiliary's transactions.
% TODO are OSTblocks' transactions blocks or dynasties from auxiliary?
% TODO do OSTblocks include forks or only the canonical chain of auxiliary (redundant if we only store latest state)
Transactions in an OSTblock each represent one block of the auxiliary chain.
An OSTblock transaction represents the state change from the beginning of its associated block to the end of that block.
Therefore, OSTblocks are generated at a slower pace.
We call $\alpha$ the height of OSTblock $\B_\alpha$.
The next OSTblock, that points to $\B_\alpha$ in its header,
is OSTblock $\B_{\alpha+1}$ at height $\alpha+1$.
Due to the aforementioned compression of blocks on auxiliary,
% TODO clarify that "+m" means any number of blocks
$\B_\alpha$ may contain auxiliary blocks $b_{\A{}i}$ to $b_{\A{}i+m}$.

The OSTblock header of block $\B_\alpha$ at height $\alpha$ contains:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A link to the previous OSTblock
	\item The signatures of the validators in $\V_\alpha$
	% TODO "state root of last finalised block"?; clarify
	\item The root hash of the state tree of auxiliary
	\item The set of validators for the next OSTblock, $\V_{\alpha+1}$
\end{enumerate}
% TODO what is the OSTblock body?
We do not store the body of an OSTblock on origin, only the header.
The content can be re-created at any time from the auxiliary chain and proven against auxiliary's state root that is stored on origin.

% TODO language whole paragraph
In order to be block proposal mechanism agnostic, we layer Casper~\cite{casperffg} on top of auxiliary.
% TODO missing context. Extend or move to validators paragraph above
Validators vote on supermajority links.
Auxiliary must follow Casper's fork choice rule.
%% TODO missing context
Checkpoints get finalised.
The Mosaic validators can transfer the state of a finalised auxiliary checkpoint to origin.
% TODO language
A validator uses the Mosaic Gateway to transfer the state to origin.
On origin, a $\frac{2}{3	}$ majority vote is required by the validators in order to commit the state to origin.
% TODO how do we trigger this info back to aux?
The state is regarded economically finalised when the block that contains the commit is considered economically final on origin.

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{mosaic}
	\caption{
		\textbf{The Mosaic state transfer.}
		% TODO "closing" is undefined here
		The closing of $\B_{\alpha-1}$ means that the finalised checkpoint $b_{\A{}i}$ is the last block of $\B_{\alpha-1}$.
		Even though the details of $\B_\alpha$ will not be known until the opening is transferred to $\A$,
		the first block in $\B_\alpha$ will be $b_{\A{}i+1}$.
		Once a checkpoint is finalised ofter the OSTgas limit has been reached,
		% TODO V or a Mosaic node? where's the difference?
		$\V$ will signal the closing of $\B_\alpha$ to $\OC$.
	}
	\label{fig:mosaic}
\end{figure}

% TODO extend this paragraph
On the auxiliary chain, \emph{OSTgas} is the equivalent to gas on Ethereum.
For transactions to be included in blocks on auxiliary, a fee is paid for the consumed OSTgas.

% TODO make clear that the OSTgas limit is only a fallback and any finalised checkpoint can be transferred
% TODO mention Gateways here or more appropriately in the introduction to mosaic
% TODO possibly move this further up
Validators could commit every finalised state from auxiliary to origin.
However, that may be infeasible from an economic viewpoint of the validators.
Therefore, we propose points on the auxiliary chain where the validators must close the OSTblock.
Whenever a certain, fixed limit of OSTgas has been spent on auxiliary since the opening of the OSTblock,
% TODO reward and punishment; how do we enforce this?
the validators must close the OSTblock at the next finalised auxiliary checkpoint.
This is marked in figure~\ref{fig:mosaic} by the dashed line.

Actors on the auxiliary chain have an economic incentive to finalise their state on origin.
% TODO OSTgas to _which_ validators?
The block creators of auxiliary will pay a fraction of their earned OSTgas to the validators as a fee when the validators move the state to origin.
% TODO context and language
% TODO why?
Due to the OSTblocks, validators can only copy the state from auxiliary to origin after the state of origin has been copied to auxiliary.
Thus, validators are incentivised to close an OSTblock and open a new one in order to earn the OSTgas fee for the transfer of auxiliary's state.

% TODO Slashing/Punishments validators on origin (e.g. when they misbehave on auxiliary)

% TODO Keeping stake four months back on origin should mean a shorter time back on auxiliary to forbid voting (3 months?)
